# Info 201 Final Project by Alex, Yujia, Peter and Wendy

Hello! Our dear users, we are Wonder4. This is our introduction page for you!
We created an interactive platform using R, and we display all the interaction with the data by using a Shiny App. 
The dataset that we chose is from Basketball Reference, a website that contains information about teams and players in the NBA. The domain of our data is limited to one certain basketball team -- the Los Angeles Lakers.
Our target audience is the people who are interested in basketball and specifically, the Lakers. They can go to different tabs and choose different filters to interact with the Shiny App that we made, and get different kinds of information and comparison from visual plots and graphs.
On the next tab, you can choose a stat category first. If you choose Single Player and then choose different player names in the Lakers. Their photos will show up on the right with brief personal information about them below. Also, their PTS.G, TRB, BLK, AST, STL, PF, and season information will show under their personal information. If you choose Top 5 of the season, you will be asked to choose a season and a category. Then a bar graph will show on the right. The top 5 players’ name will be on x-axis, and their stats of the category that you choose will be on y-axis.
On the last tab, you will be asked to choose one basketball season first, and then you will be asked to choose a player’s name. Then you will be asked to choose another season and basketball player that you want to know about. You will get table that will show all the data about these two players, so that you can compare their stats.
